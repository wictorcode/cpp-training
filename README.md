Micro projects/training with C++. Nothing really fancy.

  

## List of 'projects' inside this repo

## Building/Running

For now, i'm using .bat files to build, which -- to my knowledge -- only works on windows.

So you need a windows machine to automatically build with the provided scripts

However, you can still write your own Makefiles if you really want to.

  

Steps:

1. Each 'project' has its own folder inside of [projects](https://github.com/wictorcode/cpp-training/tree/main/projects)
2. For the program you want to run, open a terminal in the corresponding folder and run `.\build.bat`
3. This will compile the object files into `.\build\` and the .exe program will be generated inside of `.\out\`
4. The batch program will ask if you want to run the program. Press **`y`** to run the program or press any other key to exit.
